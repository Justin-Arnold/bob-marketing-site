# BOB Marketing Website


## Tech Stack
The focus for this project is both strong developer experience (DX) and adaptability to changes over time. To achieve this we are using the following technologies:

### Astro
Astro focus's on static site generation (SSG) and server side rendering (SSR), making it easier to optimize for SEO and increases overall performance. This can also be set per route, further adding to its adaptability.

Additionally, the Island Architecture allows us to load interactive components independently, ensuring our site remains fast and efficient. while still allowing SPA style interactivity.

Finally Astro's adaptability makes it perfect for future updates and changes since it allows us to use any framework we want (Vue, React, Angular, Svelte, etc.) and even allows us to use multiple frameworks on the same site. This allows for incremental adoption and implementing changes or updates without overhauling the entire codebase.

### Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI

Tailwind CSS revolutionizes the way we approach styling. It offers utility-first CSS, enabling rapid UI development with lower-level building blocks. This leads to more customizable and maintainable styles without the bloat of unused code.

Pairing it with DaisyUI, a Tailwind CSS component library, enhances our workflow further. DaisyUI provides us with a set of prebuilt components that are fully customizable, aligning perfectly with Tailwindâ€™s utility-first approach. This combination speeds up the development process, while still offering the flexibility to craft unique designs and themes that reflect our brand identity.

Together, Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI empower our team to create a visually appealing, responsive, and consistent user interface with efficiency and ease, complementing the robustness of Astro in our tech stack.
